## 2. Core Architecture Overview

### 2.1 System Flow

The Dola AI Integrated Stack follows a unified data flow pattern that connects all major components:

```
GitHub ←→ Dola AI (5 Roles) ←→ Obsidian Vault ←→ FastAPI Backend ←→ AI Providers
   ↓ PR/Issue/Release       ↓ Docs/Logs/KB       ↓ Auth/API/DB       ↓ Cost/Performance
```

### 2.2 Component Description

**Table 2-1: System Components**

| Component | Primary Responsibility | Key Technologies |
|---|---|---|
| Dola AI | Automation of PR reviews, issue triage, releases, docs, oncall | GitHub Actions, Node.js, Python |
| Obsidian Vault | Knowledge base, documentation, templates, logs | Markdown, Local REST API, Dataview |
| FastAPI Backend | API layer, authentication, data management, AI orchestration | Python, PostgreSQL, Redis, Prisma |
| AI Providers | Large language models for code generation and analysis | GPT-6 Astra, Gemini Flash, Claude Fable 5.1 |

### 2.3 Dola AI Five Roles

Dola AI operates through five specialized roles, each handling specific GitHub-native tasks:

1. **PR Manager:** Reviews pull requests, validates CI/CodeQL/coverage (≥80%), approves or rejects, and auto-merges when criteria are met.
2. **Issue Triager:** Automatically labels, prioritizes, and assigns issues based on type (bug, feature, docs, question).
3. **Release Manager:** Manages semantic versioning, generates changelogs, creates releases, and syncs release notes to Obsidian.
4. **Docs Maintainer:** Validates README updates, checks links, and ensures documentation version synchronization.
5. **Oncall Bot:** Monitors Vercel deployments and health endpoints, sends Slack alerts, and logs incidents to Obsidian.

## 4. useScope Hook — TypeScript Implementation

### 4.1 Overview

The `useScope` hook provides efficient information scope management for React applications. It enables isolated state boundaries, automatic cleanup, memoized selectors, and optional persistence to localStorage.

### 4.2 Core Features

- **Type-safe:** Full TypeScript generics support
- **Scope isolation:** Prevents cross-scope data leakage
- **Memoized selectors:** Redux-style selector pattern for optimized re-renders
- **Persistence:** Optional localStorage persistence
- **Event-based subscription:** Cross-component communication
- **Shallow equality:** Prevents unnecessary re-renders when data is unchanged

### 4.3 Usage Examples

**Basic scope with persistence:**

```typescript
type AuthData = {
  user: { id: string; name: string } | null;
  token: string | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
};

const { data, update, reset } = useScope<AuthData>('auth', {
  user: null,
  token: null,
  isAuthenticated: false
}, { persist: true });
```

**Redux-style selectors:**

```typescript
const isAuthenticated = useSelector<AuthData, boolean>(
  'auth',
  s => s.isAuthenticated
);

const userName = useSelector<AuthData, string>(
  'auth',
  s => s.user?.name ?? 'Guest'
);
```

**Dynamic scope per component instance:**

```typescript
function PRCard({ prId }: { prId: string }) {
  const { data } = useScope(`dola:pr:${prId}`, {
    status: 'pending' as 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected',
    checks: [] as string[]
  });
  return <div>Status: {data.status}</div>;
}
```

### 4.4 Performance Characteristics

**Table 4-1: Performance Advantages**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---|---|
| Shallow diff comparison | Skips re-renders when data is identical |
| Scope isolation | Clean state boundaries, no interference |
| Memoized functions | Stable references, safe for dependency arrays |
| Auto-cleanup | No memory leaks (unless persist flag is set) |
| Registry-based | Single source of truth, no data duplication |

## 5. API Security Framework

### 5.1 Security Layers

The API security framework implements defense in depth through multiple layers:

1. **Authentication:** Verifies identity using JWT tokens, API keys, or OAuth 2.0
2. **Authorization:** Controls access via RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
3. **Data Protection:** Encrypts data in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest
4. **Input Validation:** Validates and sanitizes all inputs to prevent injection attacks
5. **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
6. **Monitoring:** Logs security events and monitors for anomalies

### 5.2 Authentication Methods

**JWT Authentication Flow:**

1. Client sends credentials to `/token` endpoint
2. Server validates credentials and returns signed JWT
3. Client includes JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Server validates token signature and expiration on each request

**API Key Authentication:**

- Used for server-to-server communication
- Key passed in `X-API-Key` header
- Keys stored as hashed values, never in plain text

### 5.3 Security Headers

The FastAPI middleware applies the following security headers:

- **Strict-Transport-Security:** `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** `nosniff`
- **X-Frame-Options:** `DENY`
- **X-XSS-Protection:** `1; mode=block`

### 5.4 Rate Limiting Implementation

Rate limiting is implemented using Redis with the following specifications:

- Default limit: 100 requests per minute per client
- Client identification: API key or IP address
- Algorithm: Token bucket with sliding window
- Response headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`

---

## 6. Thread Model & Observability

### 6.1 Concept

The Thread Model provides distributed tracing capabilities through a single trace ID that travels through every service, log entry, and processing step. This enables full lifecycle traceability for requests, builds, incidents, and deployments.

### 6.2 Data Model

**Trace Object:**

```json
{
  "trace_id": "tr_01HXY8ZABC123DEF456",
  "thread_type": "deployment",
  "parent_id": null,
  "root_id": "tr_01HXY8ZABC123DEF456",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2026-09-07T10:00:00+07:00",
  "source": "github_webhook",
  "owner": "team/devsecops",
  "context": {
    "repo": "org/project",
    "branch": "main",
    "env": "production"
  }
}
```

**Span Object (Sub-step):**

```json
{
  "span_id": "sp_001XYZ",
  "trace_id": "tr_01HXY8ZABC123DEF456",
  "name": "security_scan",
  "status": "pass",
  "start_time": "2026-09-07T10:00:01+07:00",
  "end_time": "2026-09-07T10:00:12+07:00",
  "duration_ms": 11000,
  "logs": ["Rule loaded", "Dependency check OK"],
  "error": null
}
```

### 6.3 ID Format Rules

- Prefix: `tr_` for threads, `sp_` for spans
- Body: Base32 or Hex encoding (16-24 characters)
- Unpredictable: Cryptographically generated to prevent enumeration

### 6.4 Header Propagation

Every service must propagate the following headers:

```http
X-Trace-ID: tr_01HXY8ZABC123DEF456
X-Span-ID: sp_001XYZ
```

If a header is missing, the entry service generates a new trace ID.

## 7. Obsidian REST API Integration

### 7.1 Plugin Configuration

The integration uses the **Local REST API** plugin for Obsidian (author: coddingtonbear):

- **Port:** 27124 (default)
- **Host:** 127.0.0.1 (local only)
- **Authentication:** Bearer token
- **Protocol:** HTTPS with self-signed certificate

### 7.2 Key Endpoints

**Table 7-1: Obsidian REST API Endpoints**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/vault/` | List vault information |
| GET | `/vault/{path}` | Read note content |
| POST | `/vault/{path}` | Create or update note |
| PATCH | `/vault/{path}` | Partial note update |
| DELETE | `/vault/{path}` | Delete note |

### 7.3 Python Client Implementation

```python
import requests
from typing import Optional, Tuple

OBSIDIAN_URL = "https://127.0.0.1:27124"
API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "text/markdown"
}
VERIFY_SSL = False

def write_note(path: str, content: str) -> Tuple[int, dict]:
    res = requests.post(
        f"{OBSIDIAN_URL}/vault/{path}",
        headers=HEADERS,
        data=content,
        verify=VERIFY_SSL
    )
    return res.status_code, res.json()

def read_note(path: str) -> Optional[str]:
    res = requests.get(
        f"{OBSIDIAN_URL}/vault/{path}",
        headers=HEADERS,
        verify=VERIFY_SSL
    )
    return res.text if res.status_code == 200 else None
```

### 7.4 Security Considerations

- **Never expose publicly:** The API should only be accessible locally or through VPN
- **Token management:** Store tokens in environment variables or secret managers
- **CORS policy:** Restrict origins to trusted services only
- **Access logging:** All API access logged to `Obsidian/Logs/API.md`

---

## 8. Deployment & Operations

### 8.1 Docker Deployment

The FastAPI backend is containerized with Docker and orchestrated using docker-compose:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/skills_db
      REDIS_URL: redis://cache:6379/0
    depends_on:
      - db
      - cache

  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: skills_db

  cache:
    image: redis:7-alpine
```

### 8.2 CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions implement the following pipeline stages:

1. **Lint:** Code style and static analysis
2. **Test:** Unit tests, integration tests, coverage validation
3. **Build:** Docker image build and push to registry
4. **Security Scan:** CodeQL analysis, dependency scanning, container scanning
5. **Deploy:** Automated deployment to staging and production

### 8.3 Secret Management

Secrets are managed through:

- **GitHub Secrets:** For CI/CD pipeline variables
- **Environment files:** `.env` files (never committed to Git)
- **HashiCorp Vault:** For production secret management
- **Obsidian REST API key:** Stored as encrypted environment variable

### 8.4 Monitoring & Alerting

Key metrics monitored:

- API response time and error rates
- Authentication failures and permission denied events
- Rate limit violations
- System health and resource utilization
- AI provider costs and cache hit rates

Alerts are sent to Slack `#oncall` channel for P1 incidents and via email for P2 issues.
