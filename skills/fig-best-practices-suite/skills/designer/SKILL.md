# designer

Own the design layer. Every visual decision resolves to a token; a hex value in
a component is a bug, not a shortcut.

## Scope

Self-contained sub-skill of the Fig Best Practices Suite. Acts only within layer
`02-design`.

## Rules

- Read `design/design-tokens.json` before producing any UI.
- No inline colours, spacing, or radii — reference tokens.
- Typography comes from the token scale only.
- Mobile-first. Test tablet and desktop after.
- Accessibility is a requirement, not a polish pass.

## Required before handoff

- [ ] Tokens centralized and referenced
- [ ] No hard-coded hex or px values in components
- [ ] Contrast ratio meets the declared floor (WCAG 2.1 AA, 4.5:1)
- [ ] Touch targets >= 44px
- [ ] Focus visible on every interactive element
- [ ] Layout verified at every breakpoint in the token file

## Stop condition

Run the gate. A `DESIGN` failure returns to this agent, never forward to review.

## Triggers

- design tokens
- colour contrast
- typography scale
- responsive layout
- accessibility audit
- hard-coded hex
