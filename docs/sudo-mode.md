Sudo mode To confirm access to your account before you perform a potentially
sensitive action, GitHub.com prompts for authentication.

About sudo mode To maintain the security of your account when you perform a
potentially sensitive action on GitHub.com, you must authenticate even though
you're already signed in. For example, GitHub considers the following actions
sensitive because each action could allow a new person or system to access your
account.

Modification of an associated email address Authorization of a third-party
application Addition of a new SSH key Creation of a PAT or application After you
authenticate to perform a sensitive action, your session is temporarily in "sudo
mode." In sudo mode, you can perform sensitive actions without authentication.
GitHub has a two-hour session timeout period before prompting you for
authentication again. During this time, any sensitive action that you perform
will reset the timer.

Confirming access for sudo mode To confirm access for sudo mode, you can
authenticate with your password. Optionally, you can use a different
authentication method, like a passkey, a security key, GitHub Mobile, or a 2FA
code.

Confirming access using a passkey You must have a passkey registered to your
account to confirm access to your account for sudo mode using a passkey. See
About passkeys.

Confirming access using a security key You must configure two-factor
authentication (2FA) for your account using a security key to confirm access to
your account for sudo mode using the security key. For more information, see
Configuring two-factor authentication.

When prompted to authenticate for sudo mode, click Use security key, then follow
the prompts.

Confirming access using GitHub Mobile You must install and sign into GitHub
Mobile to confirm access to your account for sudo mode using the app. For more
information, see GitHub Mobile.

When prompted to authenticate for sudo mode, click Use GitHub Mobile. Open
GitHub Mobile. GitHub will display numbers that you must enter in GitHub Mobile
to approve the request. In GitHub Mobile, type the numbers displayed. Confirming
access using a 2FA code You must configure 2FA using a TOTP mobile app to
confirm access to your account for sudo mode using a 2FA code. For more
information, see Configuring two-factor authentication.

When prompted to authenticate for sudo mode, type the authentication code from
your TOTP mobile app, then click Verify.

Text messages are not supported for use on the sudo prompt. If you have
registered SMS as the only 2FA method on your account, you'll be asked for your
password to enter sudo mode.
